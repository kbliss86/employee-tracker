## Description
This project is designed to offer a user the ability to update an sql table with employee attributes using the command line. The user can view employees, roles and departments as well as add roles, employees and departments and update an employees role. I also included the ability to update an employees manager and view employees by managers and departments. The command line interface includes inquirer prompts for what action a user wants to take as well as choices derived from the stored databases for updating managers and roles!
